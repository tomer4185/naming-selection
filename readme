# Human vs LLM Naming selection

## Preprocess: 
1. First copy wanted urls to txt file repos.txt
2. Then run github_extractor with relevant urls - creates dowloaded_repos folder with all py files
3. Run repo_anonymizer to extract wanted information to file anonymized_variables.json
4. For statistics, run variable_extractor that creates variables_detailed.json and analysis.json

## LLM:
Run llm_renamer for replacing variables in extracted code.

## Evaluation:
Evaluation scripts can be found under evaluation package.
